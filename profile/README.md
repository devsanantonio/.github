**Tired of feeling isolated? We were too** </br>
When developers new to San Antonio kept expressing the lack of a dedicated developer space, we knew something had to change

**Building a Strong Foundation Together:** </br>
From the start, we knew DEVSA's in-person meetups wouldn't be about favoring a single language or tech stack. Instead, we envisioned a platform that embraced the diversity of San Antonio's developer community

**Collaboration is at the Heart of DEVSA:** </br>
By working hand-in-hand with existing organizations in the city, we've fostered a network of knowledge sharing and support. Our non-profit status allows us to secure affordable venues, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for all developers

**San Antonio's Tech Landscape is Evolving:** </br>
As the city solidifies its position as a cybersecurity hub and fosters partnerships with Monterrey, Mexico and the South Texas triangle, we're committed to ensuring our developers have the tools and knowledge to thrive in this dynamic environment

<strong>Join us in building a stronger developer ecosystem in San Antonio!</strong>
