# **Reporting Security Issues**

The project's team and community take security issues.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, go to the project's issues and create a new issue using the ⚠️ Security Report 'issue template'.

Read the instructions of this issue template carefully, and if your report could leak data or might expose how to gain access to a restricted area or break the system, please [join our discord and message one of the admins](https://discord.gg/cvHHzThrEw) and include "GitHub Security Issue" in the message.

We'll endeavor to respond quickly and keep you updated throughout the process.
